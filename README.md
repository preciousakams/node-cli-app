# CSV-Sort

> This is a command line tool that sorts a CSV file by a given column and order (For now it only sorts 3-column CSV files and sums up the third column based on the sorted data). 

> It takes in the path to the CSV file and the path to the location to save the sorted CSV file as input from the command line or terminal and returns the sorted CSV file.

> The tool is built with Node.js and Inquirer.js for the CLI and D3.js for the sorting algorithm. The application is tested with Jest.
